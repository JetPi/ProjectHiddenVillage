# Game contract: actions & targeting

## Action scopes & ID formats

- Global actions live in `GameStateResponse.AvailableActions`; per-card actions in
  `CardInstanceResponse.AvailableActions`.
- Hand card `play-card:{instanceId}` · support `activate-support:{instanceId}` ·
  battlefield `battle-action:{instanceId}` · leader
  `leader-effect:{leaderInstanceId}:{effectKey}` (effectKey = effect `Id` or
  `index-{i}`). Phase-level: `advance-phase`, `turn-end`/`endPhase`
  (`declare-end-step`), `complete-end-step`, `pass-turn`, `resolve-prompt:*`.

## Targeting state (client)

- Single picker state `pendingCardTargeting = { actionId, sourceCardInstanceId,
  validTargets, kind: 'battle' | 'effect' }` in `gameUIStore`.
  - `kind: 'battle'` = attack (optimistic rest + attack-link arrow on submit).
  - `kind: 'effect'` = plain single-target effect (leader/support/card effect).
- Board highlight + click handling is driven purely off this state.
- Summon tribute targeting is a separate `pendingSummonTargeting` state and is
  multi-toggle + confirm (see SidebarButtons).

## Effect activation decision (`trySubmitTargetedCardEffect`)

Used by `leader-effect:*` and `activate-support:*`. It first asks
`GetCardActionTargets`, then:

1. Auto-executes when `autoSelectAllValidTargets` (with valid targets), when there
   are **no** valid targets (untargeted effect), or when valid-target count equals
   `exactTargetCount` for a **non** single-pick rule (multi exact “take all”).
2. **Always enters target selection (`kind: 'effect'`)** when a single target must
   be picked (`exact/min/max` each null-or-1) and there is at least one valid
   target — even if there is exactly one candidate. Never auto-spend the effect
   (chakra) in that case; the player must click the target (via “Choose”, see
   `02-board-ui-hud.md`).
3. Multi-target effects with a range (>1 choices) are not yet client-driven.

Attack (`battle-action:*`) always enters `kind: 'battle'` targeting when valid
targets exist.

## Server `GetCardActionTargets`

Returns `GameCardActionTargetsResponse` (`IsEnabled`, `DisabledReason`,
`ValidTargets`, `Minimum/Maximum/ExactTargetCount`, `AutoSelectAllValidTargets`)
for prefixes `summon-to-field`, `activate-support`, `battle-action`, and
`leader-effect` — implemented by `InMemoryGameInstanceRegistry.GetCardActionTargets`
+ its `Build*CardActionTargets` methods. `ExecuteCardAction` applies effects to the
request’s `SelectedTargets`; effects auto-resolve targets only when
`TargetRules.AutoSelectAllValidTargets` is set.

## Backend guidance

- `GameStateResponseMapper` builds available actions (`BuildLeaderAvailableActions`,
  `BuildEffectOptionLabel`, default `advance-phase`). Server stays authoritative:
  the client only mirrors what the response exposes.
- Be careful changing how availability evaluates “valid targets” for leader effects
  (`includeValidTargets` toggle in `EvaluateEffectAvailability`) — it can flip
  enabled/disabled and the expected disabled-reason strings asserted by server
  tests.
